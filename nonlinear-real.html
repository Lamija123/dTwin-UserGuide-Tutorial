    <h2>1.1 Nonlinear Equations in the Real Domain</h2>

    <h3>Task Overview: </h3>
        
    <p>The objective is to solve a nonlinear system of equations in the real domain 
    using dTwin, where variable and parameter names include Unicode characters.</p>

    <h3>Task objective:</h3>
    <p>The goal is to solve a system of two nonlinear equations with two unknowns using the Newton-Raphson method.</p>

    <h3>Program Analysis:</h3> 
    <p>The first step is to define the target model.</p>
    <p>Code Line:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
        Model [type = NL, name = "NL with Fn", domain=real, eps=1e-6, method=NR]:
    </div>

    <p>represents the beginning of the model definition within the dTwin environment. It specifies the fun-
    damental properties of the model to be solved:</p>
        <p><strong>Model</strong> – a keyword that marks the start of the model definition.</p>
        <p><strong>type</strong> = "NL" – defines the model as nonlinear (NL = Nonlinear).</p>
        <p><strong>name</strong> = "NL with Fn" – a user-defined model name.</p>
        <p><strong>domain</strong> = "real" – specifies that all variables and parameters are within the real number domain.</p>
        <p><strong>eps</strong> = 1e−6 – sets the desired solution accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>method</strong> = "NR" – indicates that the Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the system.</p>

    <p>The next code block is <strong>Vars</strong>:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Block Vars [out = true]:
            x = 1
            y = 1
    </div>

    <p>This block defines the model variables, representing the unknowns to be computed numerically.</p>
    <p>The keyword Vars denotes the beginning of the variable list. The optional attribute [out = true] specifies whether these variables will be displayed in the simulation results.
        Variables x and y are initialized to the value 1, serving as initial approximations for the iterative algorithm.</p>

    <p>The following block <strong>Params</strong> defines the model parameters, representing constants used in the equation formulations whose values remain fixed throughout the simulation.</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Params:
            k = 2
            m = 0.5
    </div>

    <p>The <strong>NLEs</strong> block contains the system of nonlinear equations that constitute the mathematical model. 
        These equations are solved simultaneously using the numerical method specified in the Model block (method = NR).</p>

    <div class="code-block">
        NLEs:
            x^x+ln(y)=k*x+n+y*-0.2
            x^2+y^2=4+0.5*x
    </div>

    <p>The code following the <strong>PostProc</strong> line is used for post-processing of results, such as calculating additional 
        expressions based on the solution, generating graphs, etc. In this example, the block is empty, 
        indicating that no further operations are performed after solving the system. This block can 
        be valuable for extending the model in more complex tasks.</p>

    <div class="code-block">
        PostProc:
    </div>

    <p>The keyword <strong>end</strong> signifies the termination of the model definition</p>
    <div class="code-block">
    
        end // end of Model
    </div>


<p> </p>

<p><strong>Solution through the main interface</strong></p>

<p>In the dTwin application, the presentation of results through the main interface consists of three key
     windows: <strong>Log</strong>, <strong>Info</strong>, and <strong>Rez</strong>, each serving a specific purpose in monitoring the model’s 
    operation, visualizing data, and analyzing simulation results. Shown in Figure 1.1.1 in the right corner.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/z0.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1">
        <div class="caption">Figure 1.1.1: Log, Info, and Rez windows</div>
    </div>

    <p>The <i>Log</i> window  serves as the primary tool for supervising the model execution process. It displays information to the 
    user such as the cursor's current location within the code (pointer position), the number of errors identified 
    during code analysis, the total execution time of the model, and any error messages if applicable. This window is 
    highly valuable for developers and users who wish to monitor the algorithm's performance in real time and resolve 
    any potential inconsistencies or syntax errors.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Log window provides a basic diagnostic overview of the system without the need for external tools, 
    thereby accelerating the model development and testing process.</p>

    <p>The <i>Info</i> window, shown in Figure 1.1.3, contains a set of important parameters that define the simulation flow and control its execution process. At the top, there is an option to specify 
        the maximum number of iterations (in this case, 50), as well as the maximum number of repetitions (marked as -1, 
        which typically indicates that no limit has been set).

    <p>The window also displays the initial simulation time (0.000000 s) and the integration step size (0.001000 s), 
    which determines the temporal resolution and precision of the simulation. The final time (2.000000 s) defines the 
    total duration of the simulation in real time.</p>

    <p>One of the useful features includes the ability to save the results to a file, allowing for later analysis and review 
    of the data. There is also an option to generate a new tab for each new plot, which is particularly helpful for 
    visualizing and comparing results from different simulations within the same working environment. In essence, the <i>Info window </i>functions as a control panel, from which the user manages core simulation parameters, 
    defines execution conditions, and monitors the fundamental technical characteristics of the simulation process.</p>


    <p>The <i>Rez</i> window provides the final display of data obtained through the execution of the model. As shown 
        in Figure 1.1.5, this window contains a table with all simulation data, including the iteration number, info
    and the values of the variables eps, x and y. Each row represents a single simulation point, 
    and users have the ability to select specific rows, which opens an additional menu with options for data export. 
    Shown in figure 1.1.2</p>

    <div class="figure">

        <div class="caption">Figure 1.1.2: XML or HTML export</div>
    </div>

    <p>The data can be exported in XML or TXT format, which is useful for integration with other software tools, statistical 
    processing, documentation, or reporting. Additionally, there is a feature for copying selected rows, which facilitates 
    quick analysis or transfer of specific values to other parts of the application. The <i>Rez</i> window serves as the central point for interpreting simulation results, enabling the user to precisely monitor 
    how values change over time and to analyze the system's dynamics in relation to time.</p>

    <p><i>Together, these three windows Log, Info, and Rez provide a powerful environment for model development, monitoring, and 
    analysis within the dTwin platform, seamlessly integrating technical parameters, execution data, and concrete results 
    into a unified and user-friendly interface.</i></p>

    <p>Upon execution of the provided code, the following results are obtained. </p>
        
    <p>Figure 1.1.3 shows a window that informs the user about the execution status of the code—specifically, 
        whether the code executed successfully or if an error occurred during the process.</p>

    <p>Figure 1.1.4 depicts the window designated for inputting code to visualize the task results. In this
    section of the interface, the user can specify which results will be displayed and how they will be
    presented.</p>
