  <h2>Description of platform content</h2>

  <p>This section provides another example of Unicode support in the dTwin platform, this time using Chinese characters as variable and parameter names within a model.</p>

  <h3>Unicode Example Model – Chinese Characters</h3>

  <p>This model example can be found on the dTwin platform under the following path: <strong>Main Menu – Examples – Unicode – Chinese Characters</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Model Description</h3>

  <p>
    This model demonstrates the platform’s capability to handle Unicode characters, specifically Chinese symbols, as valid identifiers for variables and parameters.
    The dTwin platform fully supports such Unicode naming, allowing users to build models in various languages. This enhances model clarity and enables localization in multilingual contexts.
  </p>

  <h3>Model Concept</h3>

  <p>
    The analyzed model represents a system of linear equations describing the relationship between the quantities of fruit (in kilograms) and their total cost (in currency units).
    The variables denote different types of fruit, while the parameters represent total prices.
    By naming model elements using familiar native terms, the modeling process becomes more intuitive and user-friendly.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>
    This example illustrates how Unicode characters in variable and parameter names simplify modeling and improve readability.
    Such support is particularly beneficial in international or localized applications where domain-specific or native-language notation helps users better understand and manage their models.
