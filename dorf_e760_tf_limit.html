    <h2>4.4. Dorf Example E.760 using TF model with limit</h2>

    <h3>Task Overview</h3>
    <p>In this assignment, a control system for disk head positioning was modeled, utilizing a PD controller. The model represents an extended version of the system from Example 7.60 in Dorf's book, and it is presented in the form of a differential-algebraic system (DAE) solved by the sixth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK6).</p>

    <h3>Task objective:</h3>
    <p>The objective of this assignment is to analyze the response of the disk head positioning system to a change in the reference signal under conditions both without and with disturbances, utilizing a PD controller with output limiting.</p>

        <p><strong>type</strong> = ”DAE” – the system utilizes differential-algebraic equations.</p>
        <p><strong>name</strong> = ”Dorf Example 7.60 page 481” –  model's name</p>
        <p><strong>domain</strong> = ”real” – defines that all variables and parameters are in the real domain.</p>
        <p><strong>method</strong> = ”RK6” – the sixth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed for its solution.</p>

    <p><i>In comparing the previous and this model of the disk head positioning control system, key differences are observed related to the simulation method, parameter selection, and additional functionality.</i></p>
    <p><i>Beyond the varying PD controller parameter values, a notable distinction lies in the numerical integration method. The first model employs the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4), which is simpler and faster to execute but less precise compared to more complex methods. Conversely, the second model utilizes the sixth-order method (RK6), offering greater accuracy in simulation, particularly for more complex or nonlinear systems.</i></p>
    <p><i>Furthermore, the introduction of a controller output limiter in the second model is a crucial difference. This serves as protection against control signal saturation and reflects the physical limitations of real-world actuators.</i></p>
    <p><i>The currently analyzed model represents an improved and more realistic version of the system. By employing a more precise integration method, more moderate controller values, and incorporating a control signal limiter, this model better emulates the behavior of a real physical system, enabling a safer and more stable simulation.</i></p>



    <p>After successfully initiating the simulation, the results can be reviewed through several steps.</p>
        
    <p>As depicted in picture 4.4.1, following the simulation's execution, a window appears displaying its status. Here, you can verify whether the simulation completed without errors.</p>
