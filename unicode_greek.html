  <h2>Description of platform content</h2>

  <p>This section provides a demonstration of Unicode support in the dTwin platform, using Greek letters in model definitions as a valid part of variable and parameter names.</p>

  <h3>Unicode Example Model</h3>

  <p>This model example is accessible in dTwin via the path: <strong>Main Menu – Model – Examples – Unicode</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Model Description</h3>

  <p>
    The model is defined as a nonlinear model (<code>type = NL</code>) operating in the <code>real</code> domain, and is titled <strong>"Greek letters"</strong>.
    Although the modeling language is English, both variable and parameter names are written using Greek letters, 
    inserted using syntax e.g. <code>\alpha</code> renders as α.
    This illustrates the platform’s support for Unicode symbols in names, 
    allowing more intuitive and professional mathematical notation.
  </p>

  <h3>Model Components</h3>

  <p><strong>Vars Block:</strong></p>
    <div class="code-block">
      Vars [out = true]:
        &alpha;      // angle α [deg]
        &beta;       // angle β [deg]
    </div>

  <p>Variables &alpha; and  &beta; represent angles in degrees. Their names use Unicode Greek letters, showing the system's ability to process non-ASCII characters.</p>

  <p><strong>Params Block:</strong></p>
    <div class="code-block">
      Params:
        &theta; = 70
        &gamma; = 100
    </div>

  <p>Parameters &theta; and &gamma; are also named using Greek letters. Their values are used within the model's 
    equations.</p>

  <p><strong>NLEs Block (Nonlinear Equations):</strong></p>
    <div class="code-block">
      NLEs:
        2*&alpha; + 2*&beta; = &theta;
        4*&alpha; + 2*&beta; = &gamma;
    </div>

  <p>These equations define linear relationships between the variables and parameters. They demonstrate mathematical operations using Greek identifiers within the model structure.</p>

  <p><strong>PostProc Block:</strong></p>
  <div class="code-block">
      PostProc:
    </div>
  <p>No post-processing operations are defined for this model.</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      end        // end of Model
    </div>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    This example demonstrates dTwin’s ability to support Unicode characters in model definitions. 
    Using Greek letters such as &alpha;, &beta;, &theta;, and &gamma;
    as variable and parameter names improves the readability and 
    clarity of mathematical models, especially in engineering and scientific applications.
    This Unicode feature allows users to adopt familiar symbolic notation and helps make models 
    more intuitive and easier to interpret.
