           dTwin is a tool designed for modeling and analyzing various dynamic systems, as well as for solving complex engineering problems across a wide range of fields, including electrical engineering, mechanical 
                engineering, physics, and other technical disciplines.
        </li>

        <li>
            The platform enables users to efficiently model, compute, and visualize results through graphical representations (plotting), thereby facilitating the interpretation and analysis of the obtained data. 
            The objective of this document is to offer a thorough overview of the task-solving process using dTwin, including code development and optimization, simulation execution, and detailed interpretation of results.
        </li>

        <li>
        Through clearly explained examples and detailed instructions, users will learn how to utilize the platform’s capabilities for their specific engineering needs and how to approach complex problems through a 
        streamlined and effective workflow.
