  <h2>Description of platform content</h2>

  <p>This section provides another example of Unicode support in the dTwin platform, this time using Russian (Cyrillic) letters in variable and parameter names.</p>

  <h3>Unicode Example Model – Cyrillic (Russian)</h3>

  <p>This model, titled <strong>"Unicode demo"</strong>, can be found on the dTwin platform under the Unicode example section. It demonstrates that users can define variables and parameters using the Cyrillic alphabet.</p>

  <h3>Model Description</h3>

  <p>
    As in the previous Unicode model (with Chinese characters), this model describes a system of linear equations that links quantities of fruit (in kilograms) to their total costs (in monetary units).
    The variables <code>слива</code> (plum) and <code>груша</code> (pear) represent the amounts of each fruit, while the parameters <code>Расход1</code> and <code>Расход2</code> correspond to total expenditures.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of this model is to showcase that mathematical modeling in dTwin can be adapted to different languages and scripts.
    This improves readability and allows users to model problems in their native language, supporting broader use in educational, international, and localized applications.
  </p>


  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>
    This example highlights dTwin’s Unicode support across different languages and scripts.
    The use of Russian characters such as <code>слива</code>, <code>груша</code>, <code>Расход1</code>, and <code>Расход2</code> illustrates the platform’s ability to handle Cyrillic identifiers naturally.
    This approach supports intuitive and inclusive modeling workflows, especially useful in multilingual engineering and educational environments.
