    <h2>5.3. State Estimation (Gauss–Newton Normal Equations)</h2>

    <h3>Task Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        This task implements a state estimation algorithm in a power system using the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) method.
        The system consists of three buses, and the goal is to estimate bus voltage magnitudes and phase angles using
        available measurements of active/reactive power flows, injections, and voltage magnitudes.
    </p>

     <h3>Task Objective:</h3>
    <p>
        The objective is to perform state estimation in a 3-bus power system by minimizing the weighted sum of squared measurement errors.
        The estimation is based on measured power flows, injections, and voltages. The WLS algorithm adjusts the state variables to best
        fit the measurements while accounting for their uncertainty.

    <h3>Program Analysis:</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Definition</strong></p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Model [type=WLS domain=real name="AburExposito_"]:
    </div>

    <p>
        <code>type = "WLS"</code> – the model uses the Weighted Least Squares estimation method<br>
        <code>domain = "real"</code> – all variables and equations are real-valued<br>
        <code>name = "AburExposito_"</code> – name of the model referencing the textbook example
    </p>

    <p><strong>Variables</strong></p>


     <div class="code-block">
        Vars [out=true]:
            theta_2=0
            theta_3=0
            v_1=1
            v_2=1
            v_3=1
    </div>
    <p>These are the state variables to be estimated. <code>theta_1</code> is the slack angle and fixed at 0.</p>

    <p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>

    <div class="code-block">
        Params:
            w_inj = 1/0.01^2
            w_br = 1/0.008^2
            w_v = 1/0.004^2
            theta_1 = 0
            ...
            P_12 = 0.888
            P_13 = 1.173
            P_2_meas = -0.501
            Q_12 = 0.568
            Q_13 = 0.663
            Q_2_meas = -0.286
            V_1 = 1.006
            V_2 = 0.968
    </div>

    <p>This block contains:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Measurement weights: <code>w_inj</code>, <code>w_br</code>, <code>w_v</code></li>
        <li>Measurement values: power flows and voltages</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>WLSEs Block (Weighted Equations)</strong></p>

    <div class="code-block">
        WLSEs:
            [w=w_br] v_1^2*g_12 - v_1*v_2*(g_12*cos(...) + b_12*sin(...)) = P_12
            ...
            [w=w_v] v_1 = V_1
            [w=w_v] v_2 = V_2
    </div>

    <p>Each equation has an associated weight that reflects its measurement reliability.</p>


    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>
        The WLS model provides a robust framework for state estimation by integrating different types of measurements with varying levels
        of accuracy. It gives a realistic insight into the network's operational state and can be used for diagnostics, control, and real-time monitoring.
