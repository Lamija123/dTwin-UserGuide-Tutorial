  <h2>5.11. Power Flow: Continuation Power Flow (CPF)</h2>

  <h3>Task Overview: </h3>
  <p>This task implements a continuation power flow (CPF) method in a three-node network with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Node 1 – Slack node (<strong>V₁</strong> fixed in magnitude and angle)</li>
    <li>Node 2 – Generator bus (PV node) with voltage regulation and reactive power limits</li>
    <li>Node 3 – Load bus (PQ node) with increasing load injection <strong>S₃</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Task Objective: </h3>
  <p>The objective is to investigate the power transfer limits and system voltage stability using CPF by gradually increasing the load at node 3 while monitoring voltage profiles and regulation mode transitions at node 2.</p>

  <h3>Program Analysis: </h3>

      	Model [type=NL domain=cmplx reInit=true name="PF With PV Regulating Generator And Its Limits"]:
    </div>

  <ul>
    <li><code>reInit=true</code> ensures reinitialization for each power flow point</li>
    <li><code>S3_inj</code> increases step-by-step via the <code>Repeats</code> block</li>
    <li>Node 2 initially operates as a PV bus, regulating voltage to a setpoint of <strong>V₂ = 1.01</strong> p.u.</li>
    <li>Generator on node 2 has reactive limits: <strong>Q<sub>min</sub> = -1</strong> p.u., <strong>Q<sub>max</sub> = 1.3</strong> p.u.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The transition from PV to PQ mode occurs when the generator on node 2 reaches these reactive limits.</p>

  <h3> Graphical Results: </h3>

  </div>

  <p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Up to around <strong>S₃ ≈ 2</strong> p.u., the generator at node 2 successfully regulates the voltage, maintaining <strong>V₂ ≈ 1.01</strong> p.u.</li>
    <li>Once the reactive power demand exceeds the generator limit (<strong>Q &gt; 1.3</strong>), the regulation is disabled and node 2 becomes a PQ bus.</li>
    <li>Beyond this point, voltages on both nodes 2 and 3 decline steadily, indicating increased loading stress.</li>
    <li>Near <strong>S₃ ≈ 5.3</strong> p.u., numerical divergence and oscillations occur in v₂ and v₃, showing the proximity to a voltage collapse (nose point).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion: </h3>
  <p>The CPF analysis provides insight into the system’s ability to maintain voltage stability under increased loading conditions. The automatic transition of the generator at node 2 from PV to PQ mode due to reactive power limits plays a crucial role in the shape and stability margin of the PV curve. This approach is valuable in identifying loadability limits in planning and operation studies of power networks.</p>
