    <h2>4.1. Dorf Example E7.7 (PID) with Transfer Functions (TF)</h2>

    <p>The problem that will be analyzed below is Example 7.7, which is found on page 452 of the book 
        Modern Control Systems, by Richard C. Dorf and Robert H. Bishop.</p>

    <p>This example considers the methodology for manual tuning of a PID controller within a 
        closed-loop system. The focus is on demonstrating how to adjust the proportional term of the 
        PID controller with the aim of achieving sustained oscillations in the system's response. 
        This procedure represents an initial step in the process of manual PID parameter tuning, 
        which can serve as a basis for further optimization of the controller's operation and the 
        achievement of stable and precise control.</p>

    <h3>Task Overview</h3>
    <p>The assignment analyzes the effects of manually tuned PID controller parameters on the 
        response of a closed-loop system that includes a third-order dynamic system. The regulator 
        comprises proportional (P), integral (I), and derivative (D) components, which collectively 
        work to minimize the difference between the reference (input) signal and the actual system 
        output.</p>

    <h3>Task objective:</h3>
    <p>The objective of the assignment is to investigate the influence of the PID controller on the 
        dynamic behavior of a third-order transfer function system, and to demonstrate the 
        effectiveness of applying feedback in reducing static and dynamic errors, as well as in 
        achieving the desired system output response.</p>

    <h3>Program Analysis:</h3>  
    <p>Definition of the model under consideration:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      	Model [type=DAE domain=real method=RK4 name="Dorf Example 7.7 page 452"]:
    </div>
        <p><strong>type</strong> = ”DAE” – the system utilizes differential-algebraic equations.</p>
        <p><strong>name</strong> = ”Dorf Example 7.7 page 452” – the name of the model.</p>
        <p><strong>domain</strong> = ”real” – defines that all variables and parameters are in the real domain.</p>
        <p><strong>method</strong> = ”RK4” – the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed for solving.</p>

    <p>Block <strong>Vars</strong>:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
       Vars:
            err [out=true]
            yc
            y [out=true]
    </div>

    <p>Block <strong>Params</strong></p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Params:
            u=1 [out=true]
            Kp=370
            Ki=100
            Kd=60
            b=10
            omega_n=4
            sigma=0.707
    </div>

    <p>The functions of the <i>Vars</i> and <i>Params</i> blocks were explained in <a href="nonlinear-real.html">example 1</a>.</p>


    <p>Block <strong>TFs</strong>:</p>
    
    <div class="code-block">
        TFs:
            yc/err = (Kd*s^2+Kp*s+Ki)/s		// PID controller 
            y/yc   = 1/(s^3 + (2*sigma*omega_n+b)*s^2 + (2*sigma*omega_n*b)*s)
    </div>

    <p>The function of the <i>TFs</i> block is explained in <a href="pendulum-dae-tf.html">examples 5</a>.</p>

    <p>Block <strong>NLEs</strong>:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
       NLEs:
	        err=u-y		// negative feedback 
    </div>

    <p>The function of the <i>NLEs</i> block is explained in <a href="nonlinear-complex.html">examples 2</a>.</p>

    <p>The keyword <strong>end</strong> signifies the termination of the model definition</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        end // end of Model
    </div>

    <p>After the analyzed code was successfully executed, the results presented in the following Figurema were obtained.</p>
        
    <p>Figure 4.1.1  displays an informational window that provides the user with concise feedback on the program's execution flow—specifically, whether the simulation completed without issues or if certain difficulties were detected during the process.</p>
