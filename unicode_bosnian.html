  <h2>Description of platform content</h2>

  <p>This section presents a Unicode example model on the dTwin platform that uses Bosnian letters with diacritical marks in variable and parameter names.</p>

  <h3>Unicode Example Model – Bosnian Letters</h3>

  <p>The model, titled <strong>"Unicode demo"</strong>, demonstrates that users can define variable and parameter names using localized Bosnian characters such as "š" and "č".</p>

  <h3>Model Description</h3>

  <p>
    The model defines a system of linear equations describing the relationship between fruit quantities (in kilograms) and their associated costs (in monetary units).
    Variables <code>šljiva</code> (plum) and <code>kruška</code> (pear) represent the amount of each fruit, while parameters <code>Trošak1</code> and <code>Trošak2</code> represent total expenses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just like the previous Unicode examples using Chinese and Russian characters, this model shows that the dTwin platform fully supports the use of natural language characters.
    This capability makes model writing more intuitive and enhances readability — especially important in multilingual or localized environments.
  </p>

  

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>
    This example confirms that dTwin supports full Unicode input, including localized Bosnian characters such as <code>š</code>, <code>č</code>, and <code>ć</code>.
    This ensures that users can model systems using terminology from their own language, improving clarity and usability — especially in educational and applied engineering environments.
