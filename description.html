  <h2>Description of platform content</h2>


  <p> This section of the document provides a detailed overview of the fundamental commands within the dTwin platform and their usage. Additionally, it presents a set of functions available on 
    the platform for solving mathematical problems across various domains.</p>


 <h3>Setup commands</h3>


    <p>Figure 1.2 displays the options available upon clicking the first icon (three parallel lines) located in the upper 
    left corner of the interface. This action provides access to the core functionalities within the application.</p>

    <p>The first option, <strong>Application</strong>, allows users to open the <i>Settings</i> window or 
    exit the program via the <i>Quit</i> command.</p>

        <div class="caption">Figure 1.2: View options in dTwin</div>
    </div>

 <p>By selecting the <strong>Settings</strong> command, a window will open, as shown in Figure 1.3, allowing the user to change the 
    application language. The available language options are presented in a drop-down menu beneath the currently selected 
    language. Additionally, there is an option that enables the display of icon names in the main window of the dTwin 
    platform. This feature can be disabled by clicking the blue checkbox in the settings window.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Selecting another language and clicking on the Ok option requires restarting the application, picture 1.4.
        After that, it is possible to use dTwin in the desired language.</p>

    <h3>Modeling commands</h3>

        <p>The primary purpose of the dTwin platform is solving mathematical problems, specifically through system modeling. 
            Therefore, one of the key commands in this context is the <strong>Model</strong> command. </p>
            

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/slika6.jpg" alt="Figure 1.5" lenght=400 width=800>
        <div class="caption">Figure 1.5: Command Model</div>
    </div>

    <p>This command, illustrated in Figure 1.5, contains the following subcommands:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>New Model</strong> – Creates a new blank model for further work. This command can be quickly activated using the shortcut Ctrl+N.</li>
    <li><strong>New document from template</strong>  – Allows the creation of a new model using predefined templates. A variety of suggestions are offered to facilitate the modeling of typical systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples</strong>  – Enables the user to browse and open existing model examples, which can be useful for learning and reference purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Open model</strong> – Opens an existing model from disk. It can be accessed using the Ctrl+O shortcut.</li>
    <li><strong>Save</strong> - Saves the current model along with any changes made. This command is available only if a document is open and can be executed via Ctrl+S.</li>
    <li><strong>Save As</strong>  – Allows the current model to be saved under a new name or in a different location, thereby preserving the original document.</li>
    <li><strong>Solve </strong>  – This command is available only when a model or task is open. It initiates the solving process and provides both numerical and graphical (plot) outputs of the results.</li>
</ul>

    <p>An important part of the command <i>Model</i> is the <strong>Examples</strong> section, figure 1.6, which can serve as a foundation for 
    learning and gaining a clearer understanding of the dTwin platform. 
    These examples will be discussed in greater detail in the <a href="tutorial.html"> Tutorial</a> chapter.</p>

    </div>


<h3>Plot commands</h3>

<p><em>Detailed usage of the plot and its features is demonstrated in the example located under 
<a href="pendulum-ode.html">Tutorial – General – Pendulum Model Described by Ordinary Differential Equations</a>.</em></p>

<p>The <strong>Plot</strong> menu, figure 1.7, within the dTwin environment allows users to manage the display of simulation 
    results in the form of graphs. These commands <strong>become active only when a model is opened and solved</strong>, 
    i.e. when data is available for graphical representation (plotting). The menu includes the following options:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Full Screen</strong> – Enables full-screen display of the graph to facilitate easier viewing and analysis of results.</li>
    <li><strong>Show/Hide grid</strong> – Allows the user to toggle horizontal and vertical grid lines, which assist in reading values from the graph.</li>
    <li><strong>Show/Hide legend </strong> – Enables or disables the display of the legend, which identifies the quantities represented in the graph.</li>
    <li><strong>Save figure</strong> – Allows the current graph view to be saved as an image, which is useful for documentation and reporting purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Go to the original figure position/zoom </strong> – Restores the graph to its initial view and zoom level, which is helpful if the graph has been moved or zoomed during analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust to figure settings </strong> – Enables detailed customization of the graph’s appearance, including color schemes, line styles, axis labels, and other graphical settings.</li>
</ul>
