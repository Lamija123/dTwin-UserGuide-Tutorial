    <h2>2.4. Earthquake linearized model</h2>

    <h3>Task Overview</h3>
    <p>The Quake linearized model represents a simplified, linearized version of the "Cart-Pendulum" mec-
        hanical system, used to analyze the system’s response to external disturbances such as short-term
        earthquakes. This model introduces the approximation of small displacements and small angles, allowing the substitution of nonlinear functions like sine and cosine with their linear equivalents (e.g.,
        sin(j) ≈ j , cos(j) ≈ 1 ). This significantly simplifies the mathematical formulation, enabling faster
        simulation and analysis of the system.</p>

    <h3>Task objective:</h3>
    <p>The objective of the simulation is to analyze the dynamic response of the system to this excitation
        and examine the effects of damping and stiffness parameters on system stability.</p>

    <h3>Program Analysis:</h3> 
    <p>Definition of the analyzed model:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
       Model [type=DAE name="Quake linearized" domain=real method=RK4 eps=1e-5]:
    </div>
        <p><strong>type</strong> = "DAE" – the system uses differential-algebraic equations.</p>
        <p><strong>name</strong> = "Quake linearized" – model name.</p>

        <p><strong>domain</strong> = "real" – specifies that all variables and parameters are in the real domain.</p>
        <p><strong>eps</strong> = 1e-5 – specified solution accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>method</strong> = "RK4" – the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used for solving.</p>

    <p>Block <strong>Vars</strong>:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Vars [out=true]:
            x = 1
            v = 0.
            θ = 0.5 
            ω = 0.		
    </div>

    <p>Block <strong>Params</strong></p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Params:
            Ω = 2*pi*0.3
            M=10
            m=1
            L=1
            c_1=2
            c_2=1
            k=2
            F_0=3
            F_ext = F_0 [out=true]		//Extern force
            mult = 1/(m*L^2*M)
            g=9.81
    </div>

    <p>The functions of the <i>Vars</i> and <i>Params</i> blocks were explained in <a href="nonlinear-real.html">example 1.1</a>.</p>

    <p>Block <strong>ODEs</strong>:</p>
    
    <div class="code-block">
        ODEs:
            x' = v
            v' = mult * (m*L^2*(F_ext-c_1*v-k*x) + m*L*(c_2*ω + m*g*L*θ))
            θ' = ω
            ω' = mult * (-m*L*(F_ext-c_1*v-k*x) - (M+m)*(c_2*ω + m*g*L*θ))
	
    </div>

    <p>The function of the ODEs block was explained in <a href="pendulum-ode.html">example 1.3</a>.
        It contains the ordinary differential equations that describe the analyzed system.</p>

    <p>Block <strong>PostProc</strong>:</p>
    
    <div class="code-block">
        PostProc:
            if t &lt 1:			//Limit extern force to be active in first second only
                F_ext=F_0 * cos(Ω * t)
            else:
                F_ext=0
            end
    </div>
      
    The block has the same function as in <a href="cart-model-nonlinear.html">the previous task</a>.

    <p>The keyword <strong>end</strong> signifies the termination of the model definition</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        end // end of Model
    </div>

    <p><i>The model enables comparison with nonlinear versions of the same system, which is useful for
        evaluating the validity of linear approximations in modeling mechanical systems subjected to real
        excitations.</i></p>

    <p>Upon successful execution of the program, the obtained results are shown below.</p>
        
    <p>The interface displayed after starting the simulation is shown in figure 2.4.1.</p>

    <p>The results of the code execution shown in picture 2.4.2 are presented in picture 2.4.3. The diagram illustrates the following time dependent variables: the black line represents the
        change in position, while the green line depicts the change in velocity over time. The blue line shows
        the pendulum’s angular displacement, and the red line tracks the angular velocity. The brown line
        represents the magnitude of the external force as a function of time.</p>
