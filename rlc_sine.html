    <h2>3.2. RLC circut with Sine Generator</h2>

    <h3>Task Overview</h3>
    <p>The task involves the mathematical modeling of a series RLC circuit powered by a sinusoidal voltage of 
        frequency 50 Hz, simulating real operating conditions in power systems. The system is described using a 
        set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which model the behavior of the current through the inductor 
        (i_L), the voltage drop across the inductor (u_L), and the voltage across the capacitor (u_c) in the time 
        domain.</p>

    <h3>Task objective:</h3>
    <p>To formulate a mathematical model of a series RLC circuit with sinusoidal excitation voltage. 
        To monitor changes in key physical quantities (i_L, u_c, u_L) over time. To visually 
        present the oscillatory behavior of the system and analyze the impact of frequency, phase shift, 
        and components (R, L, C) on the dynamic response.</p>

    <h3>Program Analysis:</h3> 
    <p>Definition of the model under consideration:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      	Model [type=ODE domain=real name="Serial RLC With Sine Voltage Gen"]:
    </div>
        <p><strong>type</strong> = ”ODE” – the model solves ordinary differential equations.</p>
        <p><strong>name</strong> = ”Serial RLC With Sine Voltage Gen” – model name</p>
        <p><strong>domain</strong> = ”real” – defines that all variables and parameters are in the real domain.</p>
     
    <p>Block <strong>Vars</strong>:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Vars [out=true]:
		u_c=0
		i_L=0
    </div>

    <p>Block <strong>Params</strong></p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Params:
	t=0
	f=50
	omega=2*pi*f
	phi=pi/4
	R=5
	L=0.012
	C=8e-4
	u_max=230*sqrt(2)		// phase to ground EU LV 
	u_g=u_max*sin(omega*t+phi) [out=true]
	u_L=u_g [out=true]
    </div>

    <p>The functions of the <i>Vars</i> and <i>Params</i> blocks were explained in <a href="nonlinear-real.html">example 1</a>.</p>


    <p>Block <strong>ODEs</strong>:</p>
    
    <div class="code-block">
        ODEs:
	i_L'=(u_max*sin(omega*t+phi)-u_c-R*i_L)/L
	u_c'=i_L/C
    </div>

    <p>The Block a <i>ODEs</i> function is explained in <a href="pendulum-ode.html">examples 3</a>.
        Here, differential and algebraic nonlinear equations describing the analyzed system are entered.</p>

    <p>Block <strong>PostProc</strong>:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
       PostProc:
	u_g = u_max*sin(omega*t+phi)
	u_L = u_g-u_c-R*i_L
    </div>

    <p>After simulating the main variables, the excitation and the voltage across the coil (L) are calculated, enabling additional visualization.</p>

    <p>The keyword <strong>end</strong> signifies the termination of the model definition</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        end // end of Model
    </div>

	<p><i>The first and second RLC circuit models are based on the same physical components — resistor (R), 	coil (L), and capacitor (C) — but differ significantly in the type of excitation, which directly affects 	the system's dynamic characteristics, simulation objectives, and application scope. Different types of 	excitation lead to varying system responses. Step excitation is ideal for analyzing switching dynamics, 	while sinusoidal excitation is suitable for frequency analysis and system stability.</i></p>



    <p>Upon completion of the analyzed model execution, the generated results are presented in the following 	graphical displays.</p>
        
    <p>Figure 3.2.1  shows a dialog window that provides the user with feedback on the simulation status — indicating whether the process was successfully completed or if any irregularities occurred.</p>
