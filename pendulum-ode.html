    <h2>1.3. Pendulum Model Described by Ordinary Differential Equations</h2>

    <h3>Task Overview</h3>
    <p>The task involves the numerical solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to
        analyze the dynamic behavior of a physical pendulum model. The focus is on calculating and
        graphically presenting the time evolution of the angular displacement (theta) and angular velocity
        (omega). The model enables monitoring the influence of various physical system parameters, such
        as pendulum length, mass, gravity, and friction coefficient, on the overall system behavior.</p>

    <h3>Task objective:</h3>
    <p>The objective is to demonstrate the dynamic variation of key system variables—angular displacement 
        and angular velocity—over time, while analyzing their interdependence and dependence on
        physical parameters. This facilitates a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing
        oscillatory systems and their behavior under ideal and real conditions.</p>

    <h3>Program Analysis:</h3> 
    <p>Definition of the analyzed model:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
       Model [type=ODE name="Pendulum using direct ODE solver"]:
    </div>
        <p><strong>type</strong> = "ODE" – pecifies that the model solves ordinary differential equations.</p>
        <p><strong>name</strong> = "Pendulum using direct ODE solver" – esignates the model name.</p>
       

    <p>Block <strong>Vars</strong>:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Vars [out=true]:
            theta=pi/6	
            omega=0		
    </div>

    <p>Block <strong>Params</strong></p>
    <div class="code-block">
        Params:
            l=1		
            m=1		
            g=9.81		
            k=0		
    </div>

    <p>The functions of the <i>Vars</i> and <i>Params</i> blocks were explained in <a href="nonlinear-real.html">example 1</a>.</p>

    <p>Block <strong>ODEs</strong>:</p>
    
    <div class="code-block">
        ODEs:
            theta'=omega	
            omega'=-g*sin(theta)/l-k*omega/(m*l)	
    </div>

    <p>This block is used to define ordinary differential equations that mathematically describe the behavior 
        of the analyzed system. In this specific case, it represents the pendulum model.</p>

    <p>The keyword <strong>end</strong> signifies the termination of the model definition</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        end // end of Model
    </div>

    <p>After executing the analyzed code, the results obtained are presented below. </p>
        
    <p>Figure 1.3.1 shows  a window that informs the user about the status of the program execution,
        indicating whether the code was successfully executed or an error occurred during the process.</p>

    </div>


    <p>Figure 1.3.2 shows the code input interface used to visualize the simulation results. In this part
        of the user interface, it is possible to define which variables will be displayed and how they will be
        presented.</p>

    <p>Figure 1.3.3 presents the graphical output of the simulation execution. The pink line represents
        the variation of angular velocity (omega) as a function of time, while the purple line depicts the
        temporal evolution of the angular displacement (theta).</p>

    <p>Figure 1.3.4 presents the numerical results obtained after code execution. These results represent
        the specific values of variables calculated during the simulation using the iterative method. From
        figure 1.3.4, it is evident that the number of simulation points is 5001.</p>
